# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This website is a reference I can use during the course of this coding bootcamp. I created this study guide to teach myself basic website building tools (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and so that I have something to refer back to in the future when I need to use these skills again.

## Usage

All topics listed were discussed in the prework and this guide will act as a permanent reference point for me. Each box on the homepage (labeled HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git) can be individually refered to for notes about the subject. By opening Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel will open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. This will list topics and suggest which topic to start with.
